Sankalan is the annual tech fest of DUCS which has been our pride for more than a decade now.

Since its inception in 2005, it has been a part & parcel of lives at DUCS. 
Students from universities across India come and participate enthusiastically in this two day event. 
This is the time when everyone works together as a team and is dedicated towards a common goal to bring pride and honour to the Department.

The sole reason for this event is to nurture qualities of participants.

This App is for registration and Event details of Sankalan.
