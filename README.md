Sankalan is the annual tech fest of DUCS which has been our pride for more than a decade now.

Since its inception in 2005, it has been a part & parcel of lives at DUCS. 
Students from universities across India come and participate enthusiastically in this two day event. 
This is the time when everyone works together as a team and is dedicated towards a common goal to bring pride and honour to the Department.

The sole reason for this event is to nurture qualities of participants.
